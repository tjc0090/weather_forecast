# weather_forecast
Using the API provided by openweathermap.org, this program gets a 7 day forecast for the city of the user's choice and returns the high, low, and conditions expected for the day.


Functionality still to add:
- allow user to choose how many days they would like to receive the forecast for.

Moving forward with this project will mainly involve working with the HTML and CSS aspects of it. The goal is to have the HTML result in sort of a weekly email newsletter feel.

Troubleshooting, bugs, other issues:
- currently everything is working as expected. I want to switch the HTML generation over to using some type of templating system, but haven't finalized a decision on that.
